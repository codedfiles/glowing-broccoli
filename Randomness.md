Randomness is fundamental to the healthy functioning of many different protocols. In the context of consensus-based and MPC-based networks, randomness is often used for selecting small groups of validators (driving consensus) and executors (driving multi-party computations) from the entire network. Without strong randomness, an adversary that owns a very small percentage of the entire network could influence the selection process such that they are able to successful attack the smaller groups.
